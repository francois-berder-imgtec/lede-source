Subject: [PATCH 1/3] clockevents: Retry programming min delta up to 10 times

Under virtualisation it is possible to get unexpected latency during a
clockevent device's set_next_event() callback which can make it return
-ETIME even for a delta based on min_delta_ns.

The clockevents_program_min_delta() implementation for
CONFIG_GENERIC_CLOCKEVENTS_MIN_ADJUST=n doesn't handle retries when this
happens, nor does clockevents_program_event() or its callers when force
is true (for example hrtimer_reprogram()). This can result in hangs
until the clock event device does a full period.

It isn't appropriate to use MIN_ADJUST in this case as occasional
hypervisor induced high latency will cause min_delta_ns to quickly
increase to the maximum.
Instead, borrow the retry pattern from the MIN_ADJUST case, but without
making adjustments. We retry up to 10 times before giving up.
