Subject: [PATCH 24/50] i2c: introduce helper function to get 8 bit address
 from a message

Drivers do this in various ways, let's use one standard way of doing it.
Note: I2C_M_RD is bit 0, so the code could be simplified. To be extremly
robust and to advertise good coding practices, I still use the ternary
operator and let the compilers do the optimizing job.
